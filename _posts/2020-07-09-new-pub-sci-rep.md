### New publication out in Scientific Reports

Out today is a new manuscript from my postdoctoral lab:

[Environmental enrichment during forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration opposes gene network expression changes associated with the incubation effect](https://rdcu.be/b5vzX)
[![pdf](../assets/img/icons16/pdf-icon.png)](../docs/srep-powell-2020.pdf)

A huge thank you goes out to our collaborators in the lab of Dr. Nora Perrone-Bizzozero at the University of New Mexico.
Also to Dr. Melissa A. Wilson at Arizona State University who was essential in getting the bioinformatics analysis done.
