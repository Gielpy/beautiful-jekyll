Happy to announce that we had a publication accepted in [Drug and Alcohol Dependence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/drug-and-alcohol-dependence). A graduate student, Annika, and I shared first authorship on the paper about how miRNAs change in the rat nucleus accumbens following cocaine self-administration and subsequent abstinence and cue reactivity tests. Using a Nanostring array, we identified dozens of miRNAs that differ and followed up with an IPA analysis of the RNAs targeted by the miRNAs.

We should have proofs soon and then hopefully it'll be up not too long after that!

In personal news, my job hunt is going full bore at the moment. We are hoping to head out to Colorado in the next few months which means it's up to me to find the next step in my career!
