### New publication accepted! New repo!

We had another paper accepted in [Biomolecules](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules) that should be out soon. All about the effect of a selective
dopamine D3 receptor partial agonist on cocaine self-administration, particularly on the demand for cocaine. We evaluated demand using behavioral 
economics similar to some of my previous [work](https://gielpy.github.io/pubs/). Tons of thank yous necessary, particularly to the undergraduate
research assistants who helped run the rats and our collaborators at the University of North Texas and Temple University.

Also, I've been working through some of the COVID-19 data for Arizona that's been published by the [Arizona Department of Health Services](https://www.azdhs.gov/).
I've got a new [github repository](https://github.com/Gielpy/COVIDaz) up that has the R code, daily updated excel sheet, and some figures that I try to update daily.
If you know of any data sources to fill in the gaps in my database or have ideas for plotting things, let me know.
